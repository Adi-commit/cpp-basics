📘 C++ Basics Guide

Welcome to C++ Basics Guide — a beginner-friendly repository created to help learners (including myself) build a solid foundation in C++ programming before diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

✨ About Me

Hi! I’m Aditya Singh, a working professional currently with EY GDS, India (since 2024).
I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering from VIT, Vellore (2019 batch).

I started this repository to sharpen my C++ skills and document my journey as I prepare to strengthen my DSA knowledge. While it’s primarily for my learning, I hope it also serves as a helpful guide for others walking the same path.
